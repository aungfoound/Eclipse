 The Android platform is a software stack for mobile devices including an
 operating system, middleware and key applications. Developers can create
 applications for the platform using the Android SDK. Applications are written
 using the Java programming language and run on Dalvik, a custom virtual
 machine designed for embedded use which runs on top of a Linux kernel.

 If you want to know how to develop applications for Android, you\'re in the
 right place. This site provides a variety of documentation that will help you
 learn about Android and develop mobile applications for the platform.

 An early look at the the Android SDK is also available. It includes sample
 projects with source code, development tools, an emulator, and of course all
 the libraries you\'ll need to build an Android application. What would it take
 to build a better mobile phone?
